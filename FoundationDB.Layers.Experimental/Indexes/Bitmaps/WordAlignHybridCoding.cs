		// RULES:
		//
		// - Compressed bitmaps are a stream 32-bit words and are always a multiple of 4 bytes in size.
		//   - Word at index K (0-based) starts at offset K * 4 in the buffer
		//	 - The last word written must have at least one bit set, so by definition a bitmap cannot end up with a run of all-0 words.
		//     > this means that the empty bitmap has no data word - only a header - and is 4-bytes long
		//   - The source index of the last word is stored in the header, so that appending to a bitmap can be done efficiently.
		//     > this means that a bitmap with a single bit set will have a single literal word and be 8-bytes long.
		//	 - Words are encoded in little-endian for convenience (no need to swap on INTEL platforms), with LSB being bit 0 in the source, and MSB being bit 31 in the source 
		//	   - Word Index  ║                       0                       ║                       1                       ║ ...
		//     - Byte Offset ║     0     |     1     |     2     |     3     ║     4     |     5     |     6     |     7     ║ ...
		//	   - Source Bit  ║  7 ... 0  | 15 ... 8  | 23 ... 16 | 31 ... 24 ║  7 ... 0  | 15 ... 8  | 23 ... 16 | 31 ... 24 ║ ...
		//
		// WIRE FORMAT:
		//
		// - The empty bitmap (no bit set) is the empty slice (0 bytes, no header, no data words).
		// - A non-empty bitmap (at least one bit set) is a slice of at least 8 bytes (a header and one data word)
		// - The first 4 bytes are the HEADER, and following groups of 4 bytes are the DATA words.
		// - Word 0 contains the HEADER which encodes the offset of the HIGHEST_SET_BIT set in the bitmap
		//   > If all bits (0..31) are set (1), the bounds are unknown, which means that the bitmap is probably not yet complete (or is streamed).
		//   > If all bits (0..31) are unset (0), the bitmap is empty and should not have any data words.
		//   > By definition, this bit is in the last word (which will either be a LITERAL, or a FILLER with fill bit 1.
		//	 > The number of Data Words in the bitmap should be equal to "(HIGHEST_SET_BIT + 30) DIV 31"
		//   > The offset of the highest bit in the last word will be "HIGHEST_SET_BIT % 31"
		//   > The number of padding bits (0) inserted in the last word will then be "30 - (HIGHEST_BIT % 31)"
		// - Data words with MSB unset (0) are LITERAL words that contain 31 consecutive bits from the uncompressed bitmap with at least one bit set (a LITERAL cannot be equal to 0 or 0x7FFFFFFF)
		// - Data words with MSB set (1) are FILLER words that represent a run of N words with all bits either set (1) or unset(0).
		//	 > A compressed bitmap cannot end by a FILLER word with a fill bit of 0, but CAN start by one or more FILLER words with a fill bit of 0.
		//   > The index of the LOWEST word with at least a bit set is easy to determine by looking at the first consecutive FILLER words with fill bit 0
		//   > Optionally by counting the first bits of the following LITERAL can also help compute the LOWEST_SET_BIT index.
		//
		// Note: Bits below are ordered from 31 (right) to 0 (left) for convenience, but they are still written in little-endian in the byte buffer.
		//
		//     Bytes ║        3        |        2        |        1        |        0        ║

		//   --------║-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------║
		//   HEADER  ║ H H H H H H H H | H H H H H H H H | H H H H H H H H | H H H H H H H H ║ H = offset of the highest bit that is set in the bitmap. 
		//   LITERAL ║ 0 X X X X X X X | X X X X X X X X | X X X X X X X X | X X X X X X X X ║ X = bits of uncompressed data
		//   FILLER  ║ 1 F N N N N N N | N N N N N N N N | N N N N N N N N | N N N N N N N N ║ F = 1 or 0; N = number of 31-bit words with all bits equals to F
		//
		// SIZE AND SPLITTING:
		//
		// - A compressed bitmap can only encode a set bit up to offset 2^31 - 1, which means that it cannot encode more than 2,147,483,648 documents
		// - Since .NET use signed integers for array indexers anyway, this fits exactly between 0 and int.MaxValue
		// - In the worst case scenario (only LITERAL words), this would need 69,273,667 LITERAL words plus a HEADER word, for a total of 277,094,672 bytes (~264,25 MB).
		// - A value stored in FoundationDB has a max size of 100,000 bytes which means that we can only store a mini of 24,999 literals (worst case scenario), or 774,969 uncompressed bits (if splitting must be decided BEFORE compressing when final size is unknown).
		// - The LCM between 31 and 8 is 248, which means that you should split compressed bitmaps in 248 bit chunks to end up with no padding between chunks (31 bytes in the source makes exactly 8 x 31-bit words)
		// - There does not seem to be any power of two that is also divisible by 31, so it is not possible to split bitmaps by using bit masking or shifting
		// - There does not seem to be power of 10 that is also divisible by 31, so it is not possible to split bitmaps by nice chunks like 10,000 or 100,000
		// - Targetting a maximum worst case size of 64KB for a compressed bitmap gives a max chunk of 507,873 bits.
