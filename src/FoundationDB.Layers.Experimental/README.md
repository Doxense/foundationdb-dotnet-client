This project contains experimental layers that should not be used in production.

Everything is probably doesn't work, and is mostly intended as a sandbox, or to explore ideas.

Once a layer reach a certain level of stability and maturity, it could either be spun out into its own assembly, or incorporated into the FoundationDB.Layers.Common assembly.
