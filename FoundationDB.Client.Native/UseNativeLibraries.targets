FoundationDB.Client.Native.targets

WARNING:  DO NOT MODIFY this file unless you are knowledgeable about MSBuild and have
          created a backup copy.  Incorrect changes to this file will make it
          impossible to load or build your projects from the command-line or the IDE.

This target is used to copy the native libraries to the project output folder to facilitate local development
when referencing the FoundationDB repository by source, instead of a NuGet package.

To include this in your project, simply add the following at the end of your project file:

	<ItemGroup>
		<ProjectReference Include="..\Path\To\FoundationDB.Client\\FoundationDB.Client.csproj" />
		<ProjectReference Include="..\Path\To\FoundationDB.Client.Native\\FoundationDB.Client.Native.csproj" />
	</ItemGroup>

	<Import Project="..\Path\To\FoundationDB.Native.Client\\UseNativeLibraries.targets" />

The imported tagets will automatically copy the native libraries to your project's output folder.

To enable the loader to find the libraries at runtime, find the section of your application
startup logic that calls AddFoundationDB(...) and add a call to UseNativeClient() like so:
		
	builder.AddFoundationDb(730, options =>
	{
		// other options...
				
		// instruct the loader to use the native libraries that were distributed with
		// the 'FoundationDB.Native.Client' package.
		options.UseNativeClient();
	});
		
By default, this will probe the for the native libraries, and fail if they are not found,
which could happen if the application is running on a non-supported platform, or if the
files where not properly bundled with the application.
			
Specifying "UseNativeClient(allowSystemFallback: true)" will allow the loader to fall back
to the operating system mechanism for finding the native libraries, if you intend to deploy
them separately from your .NET application.
