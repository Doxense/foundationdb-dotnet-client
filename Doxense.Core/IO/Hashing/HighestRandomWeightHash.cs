		// Rendezvous Hashing (aka HRW) is an algorithm used to assign a bucket (from a fixed pool of candiates) for each key in a deterministic way:
		// - It requires a Hash Function 'H(key, bucket)' that compute a 'weight' for each pair (k, buckets[i]).
		//   note: in practice, we first reduce down the bucket ids into a 64-bit "seed" (using any other hash function) to speed up the processing
		// - For each key, we compute all N scores using H(key, buckets[i]), and the bucket with the highest score for this key will be selected.
		// - Each bucket can be weighted up or down using a coefficient (1.0 by default), representing the "processing power" of this node.
		//
		// Example: Buckets = { ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4 }, HF(Key, ID): random distribution over 0..1
		// 
		//  1. Choose("Foo") => ID2              //  2. Choose("Bar") => ID3              //  3. Choose("Baz") => ID1              //
		//                                       //                                       //                                       //
		//       0        ½        1             //       0        ½        1             //       0        ½        1             //
		//       +-----------------|-> Score     //       +-----------------|-> Score     //       +-----------------|-> Score     //
		//   ID1 |        *                      //   ID1 |      *                        //  *ID1 |               #               //
		//  *ID2 |              #                //   ID2 |   *                           //   ID2 |        *                      //
		//   ID3 |    *                          //  *ID3 |           #                   //   ID3 |       *                       //
		//   ID4 |       *                       //   ID4 |         *                     //   ID4 |            *                  //

		// The advantages are:
		// - If the HashFunction is well behaved, all keys will distributed randomly accross all buckets.
		// - Given the same key, same the list of bucket, and same Hash Function, all clients will always reach the same result and select the same bucket.
		// - If a bucket is removed from the pool, only the keys assigned to this bucket will be re-assigned to other buckets. Keys assigned to other buckets will not be impacted.
		// - If a bucket is added to the pool, then only the keys that are now closer to it will need to be reassigned.
		//
		// The inconventients are:
		// - All clients MUST have the up-to-date list of available buckets, including all seeds and parameters needed to compute the scores.
		// - Selecting a bucket for a key is O(n) (for n = number of buckets). But in practice, if the Hash Function is cheap, this is not an issue for "small" n (up to a few hundreds?)
		//   - note: if n is very large, a solution is to use the Skeleton-based variant which is O(log n) (cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing#Skeleton-based_variant_for_very_large_n)
		// - In case of a score tie (very low probably), another strategy must be used to select one of the candidate bucket (ex: by name order?)
		//
		// Extra bonus:
		// - If the "primary" bucket for a key is down, it is easy to decide on a "fallback" bucket by choosing the second closest weight, and so on (ie: primary/secondary server selection can be built on top of Rendezvous Hashing)
		// - The algorithm can be used to randomly order servers in a deterministic way (ie: using a custom key, and sorting buckets by weight). This could be used to decide on a connection order between hosts
		// - If the bucket's seed are changed, then the new distribution will be completely different. Thus it is easy to add a "global seed" that is used to change each bucket seed, and act as a "generation number".
		//   - ie: given another system that uses the exact same bucket ids (ex: "1", "2", "3",...), but a different global seed, then the key distribution will be completely different.
		//   -Seen from another angle, if two systems uses the same list of bucket ids, and use the same global seed, they will agree on the distribution of keys (but if used for security of encryption, one would need to use crytographically strong hash functions!)
