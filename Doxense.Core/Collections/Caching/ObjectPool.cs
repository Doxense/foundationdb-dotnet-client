	/// <summary>
	/// Generic implementation of object pooling pattern with predefined pool size limit. The main
	/// purpose is that limited number of frequently used objects can be kept in the pool for
	/// further recycling.
	///
	/// Notes:
	/// 1) it is not the goal to keep all returned objects. Pool is not meant for storage. If there
	///    is no space in the pool, extra returned objects will be dropped.
	///
	/// 2) it is implied that if object was obtained from a pool, the caller will return it back in
	///    a relatively short time. Keeping checked out objects for long durations is ok, but
	///    reduces usefulness of pooling. Just new up your own.
	///
	/// Not returning objects to the pool in not detrimental to the pool's work, but is a bad practice.
	/// Rationale:
	///    If there is no intent for reusing the object, do not use pool - just use "new".
