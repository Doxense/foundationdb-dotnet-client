# How to use

To get started, install the [FoundationDB.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FoundationDB.Client) package into your application.

```console
dotnet add package FoundationDB.Client
```

You will also probably require the [FoundationDB.Client.Native](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FoundationDB.Client.Native) package that redistributes the native FoundationDB Client libraries for your platform: `fdb_c.dll` on Windows, `libfdb_c.so` on Linux, and `libfdb_c.dylib` on macOS. They are available for x64 and arm64.

```console
dotnet add package FoundationDB.Client.Native
```

For local development, you can use [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/) to quickly spin up a working environment using a locally hosted Docker container.

> **Note:** Using .NET Aspire for local development requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Windows.

## Using Dependency Injection

While you can use the binding without dependency injection, it is very easy to register the `IFdbDatabaseProvider` service with the DI container and inject it into any controller, razor page, or other service that needs to query the database.

You can decide to manually configure the database connection, in which case you will need to provide a valid set of settings (API level, root path, ...) as well as copy a valid `fdb.cluster` file so that the process can connect to an existing FoundationDB cluster.

Alternatively, you can use the __.NET Aspire__ integration to automatically setup a local FoundationDB Docker container, and inject the correct connection string.

### Manual configuration

In your Program.cs, you should register FoundationDB with the DI container:

```CSharp
using FoundationDB.Client; // this is the main namespace of the library

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// ...

// Hook up FoundationDB types and interfaces to the DI container.
// You MUST select the appropriate API version that matches the target cluster.
// For example, '730' requires at least FoundationDB v7.3.x
builder.Services.AddFoundationDb(730, options =>
{
    // auto-start the connection to the cluster on the first request
    options.AutoStart = true; 

    // you can configure additional options here, like the path to the .cluster file, default timeouts, ...
});

var app = builder.Build();

// ...

// note: you don't need to configure anything for this step

app.Run();

```

This will register an instance of the `IFdbDatabaseProvider` singleton, that you can then inject into other types.

### Using Aspire

It is possible to add a FoundationDB cluster resource to your Aspire application model, and pass a reference to this cluster to the projects that need it.

For this, you will need to install the following NuGet packages:

In the AppHost project:
```console
dotnet add package FoundationDB.Aspire.Hosting
```

In each of the projects that need to connect to the FoundationDB cluster:
```console
dotnet add package FoundationDB.Aspire
```

For local development, a local FoundationDB node will be started using the `foundationdb/foundationdb` Docker image, and all projects that use the cluster reference will have a temporary Cluster file pointing to the local instance.

> **Note:** You must have Docker installed on your development machine. See the [Aspire getting started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/add-aspire-existing-app#prerequisites) for details.

In the Program.cs of your AppHost project:
```c#
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Define a locally hosted FoundationDB cluster
    var fdb = builder
        .AddFoundationDb("fdb",
            apiVersion: 730,
            root: "/Tenant/ACME/MySuperApp/v1",
            clusterVersion: "7.3.68",
            rollForward: FdbVersionPolicy.Exact
         );

    // Project that needs a reference to this cluster
    var backend = builder
        .AddProject<Projects.AwesomeWebApiBackend>("backend")
        //...
        .WithReference(fdb); // register the fdb cluster connection

    // ...
}
```

> **Note:** While the Aspire host is running, FoundationDB will be available on port `4550`, and can be reached using the `docker:docker@127.0.0.1:4550` connection string.

On the very first start, the cluster will be unavailable until a `create single ssd` command is executed. The simplest solution is to use `Docker Desktop` to run `fdbcli` inside the container. Once this is done, you should probably restart the Aspire host.

For testing/staging/production, or "non local" development, it is also possible to configure a FoundationDB connection resource that will pass the specified Cluster file to the projects that reference the cluster resource.

In the Program.cs of your AppHost project:
```c#
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Define an external FoundationDB cluster connection
    var fdb = builder
        .AddFoundationDbCluster("fdb",
            apiVersion: 730,
            root: "/Tenant/ACME/MySuperApp/v1",
            clusterFile: "/SOME/PATH/TO/testing.cluster"
         );

    // Project that needs a reference to this cluster
    var backend = builder
        .AddProject<Projects.AwesomeWebApiBackend>("backend")
        //...
        .WithReference(fdb); // register the fdb cluster connection

    // ...
}
```

Then, in the Program.cs, or where you are declaring your services with the DI, use the following extension method to add support for FoundationDB:

```c#
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Setup Aspire services...
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
//...

// Hookup the FoundationDB component
// note: "fdb" is the same name we used with AddFoundationDb(...) in the AppHost above.
builder.AddFoundationDb("fdb");

// ...rest of the startup logic....
```

This will automatically register an instance of the `IFdbDatabaseProvider` service, automatically configured to connect the FDB local or external cluster defined in the AppHost.

## Writing a simple Document Collection

Let's say we have a `Books` Razor Page, accessible via the `/Books/{id}` route, that will display a summary page for the corresponding book.

Assuming that we already have stored each book as a JSON document in a "collection" or key/value pairs,
where the key is the ID of the book, and the value is the book encoded as JSON bytes.

The `OnGet` method of this page needs to retrieve the JSON bytes for this document, deserialize the `Book` instance, and store it in the PageModel before rendering the HTML page.

```c#
namespace MyWebApp.Pages
{

    using FoundationDB.Client;

    /// <summary>Represent a Book that will be stored (as JSON) into the database</summary>
    public sealed record Book
    {
        public required string Id { get; init; }

        public required string Title { get; init; }

        public required string ISBN { get; init; }

        public required string AuthorId { get; init; }

        // ...

    }

    /// <summary>This page is used to display the details of a specific book</summary>
    /// <remarks>Accessible via the route '/Books/{id}'</remarks>
    public class BooksModel : PageModel
    {

        public BooksModel(IFdbDatabaseProvider db)
        {
            this.Db = db;
        }

        private IFdbDatabaseProvider Db { get; }

        public Book Book { get; private set; }

        public async Task OnGet(string id, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            // perform parameter validation, ACL checks, and any pre-processing here

            // start a read-only retry-loop
            Slice jsonBytes = await this.Db.ReadAsync((IFdbReadOnlyTransaction tr) =>
            {
                // Read the value of the ("Books", <ID>) key
                Slice value = await tr.GetAsync(TuPack.Pack(("Books", id)));

                // the transaction can be used to read additional keys and ranges,
                // and has a lifetime of max. 5 seconds.

                return value;
            }, ct);

            // here you can perform any post-processing of the result, outside of the retry-loop

            // if the key does not exist in the database, GetAsync(...) will return Slice.Nil
            if (jsonBytes.IsNull)
            {
                // This book does not exist, return a 404 page to the browser!
                return NotFound();
            }

            // If the key exists, then GetAsync(...) will return its value as bytes,
            // that can be deserialized into a Book instance.
            Book book = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Book>(jsonBytes.Span);

            // perform any checks and validation here, like converting the Model
            // from the database into a ViewModel (for the razor template)

            this.Book = book;
        }
    }
}
```

Here is a description of each steps:
- We first inject an instance of the `IFdbDatabaseProvider` via the constructor.
- Inside the `OnGet(...)` action, we can call any of the `ReadAsync`, `ReadWriteAsync` or `WriteAsync` methods on this instance, to start a transaction retry-loop.
- Inside the retry-loop, you'll receive either an `IFdbReadOnlyTransaction` (read-only) or an `IFdbTransaction` (read-write).
- We use this transaction to read the value of the `("Books", <id>)` key from the database.
  - Please DO NOT mutate any global state from within the transaction handler! The handler could be called MULTIPLE TIMES if there are any conflicts or retryable errors!
  - Try to perform any pre-processing or post-processing OUTSIDE of the retry-loop. Remember, the transaction instance is only valid for 5 seconds!
- After the retry loop, inspect the result:
  - If the key was not found in the database, `GetAsync(...)` will have returned `Slice.Nil`, in which case `IsNull` will be `true`.
  - Otherwise, `GetAsync(...)` will have returned a `Slice` containing the bytes of the value, which are expected to be a JSON document.
- We de-serialize the JSON document into a `Book` record, that we can then pass to the Razor Template to be rendered into an HTML page.

## Using the Directory Layer

In real-world usage, it is __strongly encouraged__ to use the __Directory Layer__ to organize your data into <b>subspaces</b>, that can help you split the database into independent "containers".

The Directory Layer emulates a tree of "Subspace Directories", and maintains a mapping from paths to short integer prefixes.
Each directory can be seen as the equivalent of a "folder" in a traditional disk volume, where the file system would allocate a cluster or i-node number: applications will think using paths and folder names, while the file system will use integers to point to location on the disk.

For example, if the path `/Tenant/ACME/MySuperApp/v1/Documents/Books` is given the prefix `42`, then the keys in this subspace will be shortened to `(42, "BOOK_123")` instead of the very long `("Tenant", "ACME", "MySuperApp", "v1", "Documents", "Books", "BOOK_123")`, allowing for a reduction of almost 50 bytes per key.

In your AppHost:
```csharp

    // Define a locally hosted FoundationDB cluster
    var fdb = builder
        .AddFoundationDb("fdb",
            apiVersion: 730,
            root: "/Tenant/ACME/MySuperApp/v1",
            clusterVersion: "7.3.68",
            rollForward: FdbVersionPolicy.Exact
        );
```

In you web application project:
```csharp
public sealed class BookOptions
{

    /// <summary>Path to the root subspace of the application, where all data is stored</summary>
    public FdbPath BasePath { get; set; } // ex: "Documents/Books"

}

// ...

builder.Services.Configure<BookOptions>(options =>
{
    // note: in practice, this value should be read from the Configuration
    options.BasePath = FdbPath.Relative("Documents", "Books");
});
```

In your Razor Page:
```csharp
public class BooksModel : PageModel
{

    public BooksModel(IOptions<BookOptions> options, IFdbDatabaseProvider db)
    {
        this.Options = options;
        this.Db = db;
    }

    private IFdbDatabaseProvider Db { get; }

    private IOptions<BookOptions> Options { get; }

    // ... other properties unchanged

    public async Task OnGet(string id, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Starts a transaction to read the value of the document in the database
        Slice jsonBytes = await this.Db.ReadAsync((tr) =>
        {
            // Get the location that corresponds to this path
            var location = this.Db.Root[this.Options.Value.BasePath];

            // "Resolve" this location into a Directory Subspace
            // that will add the matching prefix to our keys
            var subspace = await location.Resolve(tr);

            // Use this subspace to generate our key:
            var key = subspace.Key(id);

            // Read the value of the key in the database.
            Slice value = await tr.GetAsync(key);
            // note: the key will be rendered into bytes inside GetAsync(),
            // using pooled buffers or the stack for small keys

            return value;
        }, ct);

        // The rest of the logic is the same a the previous version
        // ...
    }

}
```

The call to `location.Resolve()` queries the Directory Layer to resolve the logical path into a key _prefix_, which will usually be two or three bytes long.

The call to `subspace.Key(...)` returns a key that is a small struct wrapping the id (ex: `"BOOK_123"`) and the resolved `subspace` prefix.

This key will not be immediately "rendered" into bytes, meaning it can be further manipulated, converted into a range, other items can be added to it. It is only when it is passed to `tr.GetAsync(...)` that the key will be converted into bytes, using pooled buffers (or the stack for short keys).

In this example, the subspace prefix (`'\x15\x2A'`) and the binary representation of the string `"BOOK_123"` (`'\x02BOOK_123_\x00'`) will be combined
into the complete binary key `'\x15\x2A\x02BOOK_123_\x00'` which (hopefully) contains the bytes for our JSON document in the database.

A nice property of the Directory Layer is that it also uses the Tuple Encoding to generate the prefixes (from small integers), meaning that decoding the complete key back into a tuple (using `TuPack.Unpack(...)`) will produce a tuple with the subspace prefix as the first element,
followed by the rest of the elements that make up the key. In our example, it will decode into the tuple `(42, "BOOK_123")`.

Please note that, if you are using **Directory Partitions**, the prefix can be composed of multiple integers (one per partition level).
If, for example, the `/Tenants/ACME` directory is a **partition** with allocated prefix `(42, ...)` (`'\x15\x2A'` in binary),
and `./MySuperApp/v1/Documents/Books` is a folder within this partition with allocated prefix `(1234, ...)` (`'\x16\x04\xD2'` in binary),
then all the keys inside this folder will use the prefix `(42, 1234, ...)` (`'\x15\x2A\x16\x04\xD2'` in binary) adding an overhead of 5 bytes per key.

## Working with Layers

Writing database logic directly inside Razor Pages or API controllers is not very practical or even desirable! In a real application, all this logic should be moved into a separate "data provider" abstraction.

In the FoundationDB ecosystem, such abstractions are commonly called __Layers__.

Some layers can be very simple, directly accessing the database via the low level Key/Value API: `GetAsync`, `GetRange`, `Set`, `Clear`, ...

Other layers can build on top of other layers, adding a new abstraction level, to provide Maps, Indexes, Queues, Stacks, etc...

You can build more and more complex layers until you end up with abstractions such as Document Collections, PubSub, Message Queues, Worker Pools, Metrics, Vector Databases, ...

In our simple example, let's imagine that we want to create a `BooksProvider` service that can create, update, read and query books.

This service would be injected into the controller and provide a set of nicer methods, like `InsertAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, `FetchAsync`, etc...

```csharp
public sealed class BooksProviderOptions
{

    /// <summary>Path to the root subspace of the application, where all data is stored</summary>
    public FdbPath BasePath { get; set; } // ex: "Documents/Books"

    // any other relevant options...
}

public sealed class BooksProvider
{

    public BooksProvider(IFdbDatabaseProvider db, IOptions<BooksProviderOptions> options)
    {
        this.Db = db;
        this.Options = options.Value;

        // get the location that corresponds to this path
        this.Location = this.Db.Root[this.Options.Value.BasePath].AsDynamic();
    }

    public IFdbDatabaseProvider Db { get; }

    public BooksProviderOptions Options { get; }

    public DynamicKeySubspaceLocation Location { get; }

    public async Task InsertAsync(IFdbTransaction tr, Book book)
    {
        // first, convert the book into JSON
        Slice jsonBytes = /* use your preferred library to serialize a Book into bytes */

        // we need to resolve the subspace
        var subspace = await this.Location.Resolve(tr);

        // define the key that will hold this document in this subspace
        var key = subspace.Key(book.Id);

        // set the value of the this key to be the JSON bytes for this new document
        tr.Set(key, jsonBytes);
    }

    public async Task<Book?> FetchAsync(IFdbTransaction tr, string id)
    {
        // we need to resolve the subspace
        var subspace = await this.Location.Resolve(tr);

        // define the key that should hold this document in this subspace
        var key = subspace.Key(id);

        // and store the document
        var jsonBytes = await tr.GetAsync(key);

        if (jsonBytes.IsNull)
        { // Document not found !
            return null;
        }

        // Deserialize the book
        Book book = /* use your preferred library to deserialize bytes back into a Book */

        return book;
    }

    // other methods...
}
```

With this simple class, we have created an abstraction that resembles a `Dictionary<string, Book>`, except that it will be stored in the database.

Update your main startup logic to register `BooksProvider` with the DI:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddSingleton<BooksProvider>()
    .Configure<BooksProviderOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.BasePath = FdbPath.Relative("Documents", "Books");
        // other settings...
    });
```

Now that we have a `BooksProvider`, we can simplify our Razor Page as follows:

```csharp
public class BooksModel : PageModel
{

    public BooksModel(BooksProvider books, IFdbDatabaseProvider db)
    {
        this.Books = books;
        this.Db = db;
    }

    private BooksProvider Books { get; }

    private IFdbDatabaseProvider Db { get; }

    public Book Book { get; private set; }

    public async Task OnGet(string id, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // simply call our provider to fetch the book with this id.
        this.Book = await this.Db.ReadAsync(tr => this.Books.FetchAsync(tr, id), ct);
    }

}
```

You may notice that we are still creating the transaction inside `OnGet`, and passing the transaction to our provider,
rather than letting it creates its own transaction.

This is because, if the transaction is handled by the controller itself, it can _combine_ multiple layers inside the _same_ transaction.

For example, you might update a book in a Document Collection (with indexes), queue a background job using to Worker Pool, and publish an event to a PubSub channel, all within the same transaction.

```csharp
public async Task OnPost(Book book, CancellationToken ct)
{
    // perform some model validation, ACL checks, ...

    await this.Db.WriteAsync(async tr =>
    {
            // insert the new book in the collection
            await this.Books.InsertAsync(book)

            // instruct a worker to start converting the various thumbnails for the book
            await this.WorkerPool.QueueWorkItemAsync(new GenerateThumbnailsForNewBookEvent()
            {
                Id = book.Id,
                /* args ... */
            });

            // push an event notifying subscribers that a new book was created
            await this.PubSub.Notify(new BookCreationEvent { Id = book.Id, /* args... */});
    }, ct);

    // handle post-processing, logging, redirecting to the landing page for the new book...
}
```

This layered approach ensures __atomicity__: if any step fails, or if the transaction fails to commit for any reason, it will be as if the request never happened: no document was added, no work item was queued, and no event was published.

# Deployment

## Docker containers

The easiest way to deploy is to use one of the [ASP.NET Core Runtime docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-aspnet/) provided by Microsoft, such as `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0` or newer.

In order to function, the FoundationDB Native client library (`fdb_c.dll` on Windows, `libfdb_c.so`) needs to be present in the container image. The easiest way is to simply copy them from the [FoundationDB Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/foundationdb/foundationdb) that contains these files.

Example of a `Dockerfile` that will grab v7.3.x binaries and inject them into you application container:

```Dockerfile
# Version of the FoundationDB Client Library
ARG FDB_VERSION=7.3.53

# We will need the official fdb docker image to obtain the client binaries
FROM foundationdb/foundationdb:${FDB_VERSION} as fdb

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0

# copy the binary from the official fdb image into our target image.
COPY --from=fdb /usr/lib/libfdb_c.so /usr/lib

WORKDIR /App

COPY . /App

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyWebApp.dll"]
```

## Manual deployment

The easiest solution is to install the `foundationdb-clients-X.Y.Z` packages from `https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/downloads.html`. Only the client packages should be installed, unless you also intend to run the cluster locally.

If you are manually copying your application files to the destination, either by unzip into a folder, or using a single-exe deployment, it is still necessary to also copy the `fdb_c.dll` or `libfdb_c.so` binaries to the destination

If, for any reason, you cannot copy the client binary to the default platform location (ex: `/usr/lib` on Linux), you can specify the full path to the library by settings the `NativeLibraryPath` option, or setting the `Aspire:FoundationDb:Client:NativeLibraryPath` key in the `appSettings.json` file (see the `FdbClientSettings` class other available settings).

If you need to troubleshoot the connection to the FoundationDB cluster, from the point of view of your application, it is also recommended to install `fdbcli` (comes with the `foundationdb-clients` package, needs to be manually deployed if not).

# How to build

## Visual Studio Solution

You will need Visual Studio 2022 version 17.12 or above to build the solution (C# 13 and .NET 9.0 support is required).

### From the Command Line

You can also build, test and compile the NuGet packages from the command line using the `dotnet` CLI:

- `dotnet build` to build (in DEBUG) all the projects in the solution
- `dotnet test` to run the unit tests (requires a working local FoundationDB cluster).

### As a sub-module

Most projects in this repository are targeting multiple frameworks, meaning that each project will be build several times, one for each target.

When consuming this repository as a sub-module inside another repository, all the included projects will still want to build for all these targets, even if your parent solution only targets one framework (or a different subset).

This can also cause issues if you application is targeting an older .NET runtime and SDK (for example `net9.0` using the .NET 9.0.x SDK), which do not support more recent targets from this repo (ex: `net10.0`).

By default, the `Directory.Build.props` will attempt to detect when it is inside a git sub-module, and import any `Directory.Build.props` in the parent directory.

> **Note:** Some CI build environments may checkout sub-module in non-standard way. If this happens, you can set the environment variable `FDB_BUILD_PROPS_OVERRIDE` to `1` in order to bypass the check.

This parent props file can then override a series of msbuild variables that are injected in the `TargetFrameworks` property of all `.csproj` in this repo:
- `CoreSdkVersions`: overrides the value of all the other variables at once. Use this is you are single-targeting.

If you are multi-targeting and need more fine grained precision, you can use the following variables:
- `CoreSdkRuntimeVersions`: targets for all the core libraries (FoundationDB.Client.dll, ...) that are redistributed
- `CoreSdkToolsVersions`: targets for all the tools and executables (FdbShell, FdbTop, ...) that are redistributed
- `CoreSdkUtilityVersions`: targets for all the internal tools and executables that are only used for building, testing, and are not expected to be redistributed.
- `CloudSdkRuntimeVersions`: targets for all libraries that reference .NET Aspire (which is only supports .NET 8 or later).

If you parent repository is also multi-targeting, you can specify several targets, like for example `net9.0;net10.0`. Please note that is you target a more recent framework that is not supported by this repo, they may fail to build properly!

An example of a parent `Directory.Build.props` that overrides the build to only target `net9.0`:
```xml
<Project>
	<PropertyGroup>

		<!-- Force all projects in the FoundationDB sub-module to target net9.0 -->
		<CoreSdkVersions>net9.0</CoreSdkVersions>

	</PropertyGroup>

An example of a parent `Directory.Build.props` that multi-targets `net9.0` and `net10.0`, but only want to build the tools for `net10.0`:
```xml
<Project>
	<PropertyGroup>

		<!-- If you are using FoundationDB.Client, SnowBank.Core, etc... -->
		<CoreSdkRuntimeVersions>net9.0;net10.0</CoreSdkRuntimeVersions>

		<!-- If you are using the FoundationDB .NET Aspire Integration -->
		<CloudSdkRuntimeVersions>net9.0;net10.0</CloudSdkRuntimeVersions>

		<!-- If you are using any of the tools (FdbShell, FdbTop) -->
		<CoreSdkToolsVersions>net10.0</CoreSdkToolsVersions>

	</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

# How to test

The test projects are using NUnit 4, and the test running must run as a 64-bit process (32-bit is not supported).

> In order to run the tests, you will also need to obtain the 'fdb_c.dll'/`libfdb_c.so` native library.

You can either run the tests from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, using any extension (like ReSharper), or from the command line via `dotnet test`.

> WARNING: All the tests try to run in a dedicated subspace, but there is a possibility of data corruption if they are running against a test or staging cluster! You should run the test against a local cluster where all the data is considered expandable!

# Implementation Notes

Please refer to https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/ to get an overview on the FoundationDB API, if you haven't already.

This .NET binding has been modeled to be as close as possible to the other bindings (Python especially), while still having a '.NET' style API. 

There were a few design goals, that you may agree with or not:
* Reducing the need to allocate `byte[]` as much as possible. To achieve that, I'm using a `Slice` struct that is the logical equivalent of `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`, but more versatile.
* Mapping FoundationDB's Future into `Task<T>` to be able to use `async`/`await`. 
* Reducing the risks of memory leaks in long running server processes by wrapping all FDB_xxx handles with .NET `SafeHandle`. This adds a little overhead when P/Invoking into native code, but will guarantee that all handles get released at some time (during the next GC).
* The Tuple layer has also been optimized to reduce the number of allocations required, and cache the packed bytes of often used tuples (in subspaces, for example).

However, there are some key differences between Python and .NET that may cause problems:
* Python's dynamic types and auto casting of Tuples values, are difficult to model in .NET (without relying on the DLR). The Tuple implementation try to be as dynamic as possible, but if you want to be safe, please try to only use strings, longs, bools and byte[] to be 100% compatible with other bindings. You should refrain from using the untyped `tuple[index]` indexer (that returns an object), and instead use the generic `tuple.Get<T>(index)` that will try to adapt the underlying type into a T.
* The Tuple layer uses ASCII and Unicode strings, while .NET only have Unicode strings. That means that all strings in .NET will be packed with prefix type 0x02 and byte arrays with prefix type 0x01. An ASCII string packed in Python will be seen as a byte[] unless you use `ITuple.Get<string>()` that will automatically convert it to Unicode.
* There is no dedicated 'UUID' type prefix, so that means that `System.Guid` would be serialized as byte arrays, and all instances of byte 0 would need to be escaped. Since `System.Guid` are frequently used as primary keys, I added a new custom type prefix (0x30) for 128-bits UUIDs and (0x31) for 64-bits UUIDs. This simplifies packing/unpacking and speeds up writing/reading/comparing Guid keys.

The following files will be required by your application
* `FoundationDB.Client.dll` : Contains the core types (FdbDatabase, FdbTransaction, ...) and infrastructure to connect to a FoundationDB cluster and execute basic queries, as well as the Tuple and Subspace layers.
* `FoundationDB.Layers.Commmon.dll` : Contains common Layers that emulates Tables, Indexes, Document Collections, Blobs, ...
* `fdb_c.dll`/`libfdb_c.so` : The native C client that you will need to obtain from the official FoundationDB Windows setup or Linux client packages.

# Known Limitations

* Since the native FoundationDB client is 64-bit only, this .NET library is also for 64-bit only applications! Even though it targets AnyCPU, it would fail at runtime. _Don't forget to disable the `Prefer 32-bit` option in your project Build properties, that is enabled by default!_ 
* You cannot unload the fdb C native client from the process once the network thread has started. You can stop the network thread once, but it does not support being restarted. This can cause problems when running under ASP.NET.
* FoundationDB does not support long running batch or range queries if they take too much time. Such queries will fail with a 'past_version' error. The current maximum duration for read transactions is 5 seconds.
* FoundationDB has a maximum allowed size of 100,000 bytes for values, and 10,000 bytes for keys. Larger values must be split into multiple keys
* FoundationDB has a maximum allowed size of 10,000,000 bytes for writes per transactions (some of all key+values that are mutated). You need multiple transaction if you need to store more data. There is a Bulk API (`Fdb.Bulk.*`) to help for the most common cases (import, export, backup/restore, ...)
* See https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/known-limitations.html for other known limitations of the FoundationDB database.
