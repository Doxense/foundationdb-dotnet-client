		// Example: Inner iterator reads 10 items from the db, using 3 pages of 4 items, 3 items and then 3 items. The sequence of calls to Inner.MoveNext() will look like this:

		// query = db.GetRange(...).Batched(CAPACITY).Select(T[] => ...).ToListAsync()
		//           | ^ Inner ^   | ^ Outer         | ^ Parent        | ^ Execution point

		// - Outer.MoveNext() called by Parent
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => pending, waiting for page 1
		//	  							   ... (waiting for db)
		//	  						   => completed, Current = item #0
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #1
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #2
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #3
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => pending, waiting for page 2, on hold
		//   => Publish([ item#0, item#1, item#2, item#3 ])
		// - batch being processed by Parent...
		//                                 ... (db returned page 2)
		// - Outer.MoveNext() called Parent
		//   - (pending task)          => completed, Current = item #4
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #5
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #6
		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => pending, waiting for page 3, on hold
		//   => Publish([ item#4, item#5, item#6 ])
		// - batch being processed by Parent...
		//                                 ... (db returned page 3)
		// - Outer.MoveNext() called by Parent

		//   - Inner.MoveNext().Status => completed, Current = item #8
