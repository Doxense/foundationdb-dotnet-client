	/// A subspace is the logical equivalent of a key prefix that is implicitly prepended to all keys generated from it.
	/// A "vanilla" data subspace does not imply any encoding scheme by default, but can be wrapped into a more complex subspace which includes Key Codec.
	/// </remarks>
	/// 
	/// <example>In pseudo code, and given a 'MySubspaceImpl' that implement <see cref="IKeySubspace"/>:
	/// <code>
	/// subspace = new MySubspaceImpl({ABC})
	/// subspace.ConcatKey({123}) => {ABC123}
	/// subspace.ExtractKey({ABC123}) => {123}
	/// subspace.ExtractKey({DEF123}) => ERROR
