		// Tuples should, by default, behave as closely to Python's tuples as possible. See http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences

		// Implementation notes:
		// - Tuples are an immutable list of "objects", that can be indexed from the start or the end (negative indexes)
		// - Unless specified otherwise, end offsets are usually EXCLUDED.
		// - Appending to a tuple returns a new tuple (does not mutate the previous)
		// - Getting the substring of a tuple return a new tuple that tries to reuse the objects of the parent tuple
		// - There are no guarantees that two different tuples containing the "same" values return the same HashCode, meaning that it should not be used as keys in a Dictionary

		// Performance notes:
		// - Accessing the Count and Last item should be fast, if possible in O(1)
		// - Appending should also be fast, if possible O(1)
		// - Getting the substring of a tuple should as fast as possible, if possible O(1). For list-based tuples, it should return a view of the list (offset/count) and avoid copying the list
		// - If an operation returns an empty tuple, then it should return the STuple.Empty singleton instance
		// - If an operation does not change the tuple (like Append(STuple.Empty), or tuple.Substring(0)), then the tuple should return itself
		// - If the same tuple will be packed frequently, it should be memoized (converted into a MemoizedTuple)


		//TODO: BUGBUG: the old name (ITuple) collides with System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ITuple which is made public in .NET 4.7.1+
		// This interfaces defines an indexer, and the property "Length", but we are using "Count" which comes from IReadOnlyList<object> ...
