		#region Important Note: Differences with Python's @transactional and Java's TransactionContext

		// This interface is supposed to be the equivalent of the @transactional Python attribute, and the TransactionContext base class in Java,
		// but it has one MAJOR difference with the other bindings!
		//
		// In the other bindings, the notion of @transactional is a way to hide, from the caller, the behaviour of the object in case of failures:
		// - sometimes the errors will bubble up (if the instance is a Transaction), and the caller has to deal with it
		// - sometimes the errors will be retried under the hood an unspecified number of times, and may or may not still blow up at some point.

		// I think that this is a very dangerous thing, for the following reasons:
		// 1. This can easily create race conditions and weird bugs: since your lambda may or may not be called multiple times, the code must be aware of this fact!
		//   => the most common bug is to update a global cache or state inside the lambda, BEFORE the transaction is committed. This can either fill the case with invalid value (commit fails),
		//      or worse you could update multiple times a global value if the transaction is retried.
		// 2. This is not composable: even though the actions themselves could be composable, the code that must deal with errors and cancellation is NOT.
		//   If you want to write robust code you HAVE to know the exact behavior of the instance, which would force you to have different code path depending on the KIND of transactional instance you got.
		//   => If you have to check the actual type (Transcation or Database) anyway, why not explicity ask for one or the other?
		// 3. Since .NET cannot simulate the @transactional Python attribute behavior easily, you are forced to add multiple version of the methods, ones that takes IFdbTransactions and ones that take an IFdbTransactional
		//   This create a lot of code duplication, and you end up with alias methods that are simply doing "FooAsync(IFdbTransaction dbOrTrans, ...) { return db.ReadWriteAsync((tr) => FooAsync(tr, ...), ...); }
		//   => the caller of the layer could easily write the same thing, and now would be in a position to compose multiple calls to the layer (and other layers) in the same retry loop.

		// For these reasons, regular IFdbTransaction DO NOT implement this interfafe, and the interface is called "IFdbRetryable" instead of "IFdbTransactional" (which used to be the name of this interface before the design change)
